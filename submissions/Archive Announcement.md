# Archive Announcement
Due to the recent influx of participants, the number of PRs has continued to rise, and more and more PRs are being merged. As a result, the size of this repository has grown significantly. Some participants have even found that cloning the repo has become more difficult due to its large size.

After discussions with the team, we've decided to **archive** the files in the **Submissions** folder that have already been merged. This step is being taken to reduce the repository size and ensure that the event can continue smoothly.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
